### Getting node and npm on Windows
 * Install node.js from [here](http://nodejs.org)
 * Right click on "This PC" or "My Computer", go to Advanced System Settings and edit Environment Variables
 * Add this to your PATH: `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\npm;C:\Program Files\nodejs`
    * The first path might already be there, the second is neglected by the installer as of this time of writing
 * Close and open your terminals. Commands like `npm` and `node` should now work.
